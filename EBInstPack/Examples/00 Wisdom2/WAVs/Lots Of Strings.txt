005 Arco Basses
006 Arco Celli
007 Arco Violas
008 Arco Violins
009 Marcato 1 (includes a bass note)
010 Marcato 2 (includes a bass note, very similar and I had to go down an octave to get the same pitches)
012 Concerto
022 Resting Pad (I think this is the weird octave one)
050 Timpani (thought I'd throw this in there, it's cool)
084 Gently Now (I guess a few of these have the weird multi-octave thing going)
099 RoomOfStrings
109 String Thing
125 Whistl'n Joe (this is the lead from the X-Files theme song)
142 CelloPhane (I tried making a BRR of this one and it didn't sound good. The bass note is neat though)
147 Arco Vlns (wait, didn't we already do this one?)
148 Arco Duet
149 Str Section (is it just me or are all of these sounding the same)
150 Arco Strings (This appears to have some kind of weird volume envelope)
151 In The Pit
